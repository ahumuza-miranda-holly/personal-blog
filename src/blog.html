                <h2>The Power of literature across Timelines</h2>

                <p>
                    Literature is more than just storytelling - it is a mirror of society, culture, the human soul
                    --who we are! Through novels, poems, plays and movies.. writer explore
                    <strong>identity</strong>,<em>morality</em>,<mark>love</mark>, conflict and truths
                    One of the most celebrated authors in English literarture is <strong>Jane Austen</strong>
                    It all started with Enid Blyton, ah yes! the irony, my love for literature did not begin with some 
                    legendary author like Emily Bronte or Doestoevsky. Rather it begun with a child author and i specifically
                    loved her secret seven series. I later fell in love with one of her best works yet <q> The Twins at St. Clare's</q>
                    Ths was the official beginning if my love for literature, probably the first illustration-less novel i read.
                </p>
                <p>
                    To broaden my journey further into literature i fell in love with fiction, Im talking Harry Potter.. i most certainly
                    loved the movies and so i gave the books a chance. My brother then introduced me to the works of Rick Riordan
                    <strong>The Heroes Of Olympus</strong> dare i say i fell n love with specific characters and yes i am quite stacked when
                    it comes to the knowledge of greek and roman dieties. I am quite ashamed to say i didi have a phase of Wattpad and light reader.
                    what can i say, we were quite bored during lockdown.       
                </p>
                <p>
                    If im being honest i would write four whole pages of this taking you deeper into my journey. So allow me to say
                    that i recently about two years back fell in love with old literature due to the lack of spice. and yes im also
                    a hopeless romantic for the kind of love they posses. like hello..have you seen the movues Pride and Prejudice <mark>2005</mark>
                    as of now i can say my favorite novels are
                    <ol>
                        <li>Pride and Prejudice</li>
                        <li>Jane Eyre</li>
                        <li>The Sun and the Star</li>
                    </ol>
                    and if im being real,those are probably not all because i love so many! so ill just say to mention but a few.
